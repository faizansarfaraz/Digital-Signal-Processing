# Digital-Signal-Processing
This repository contains a collection of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) tasks, implemented in the MATLAB programming language. The focus of this repository is to provide clear and well-documented code for educational and research purposes and to serve as my Hub of submitted DSP tasks.

## Contents
Spectral analysis techniques such as FFT 
Filtering techniques such as Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass and Band Stop filters ( to be added )
Signal modulation techniques such as AM, FM and PM ( to be added )

## Requirements
1. MATLAB Software
2. Signal Processing Toolbox

## Contributing
